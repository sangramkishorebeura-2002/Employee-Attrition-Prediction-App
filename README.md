| Feature | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `satisfaction_level` | Employee satisfaction score (0–1) |
| `last_evaluation` | Last performance evaluation score |
| `number_project` | Total projects assigned |
| `average_montly_hours` | Average monthly working hours |
| `time_spend_company` | Tenure in years |
| `Work_accident` | 1 = Had accident, 0 = No accident |
| `promotion_last_5years` | 1 = Got promoted, 0 = Not promoted |
| `department` | Department name |
| `salary` | Salary level: low / medium / high |
| `left` | Target variable: 1 = Left, 0 = Stayed |

📊 **Total Employees:** 15,000  
📈 **Overall Attrition Rate:** 24%

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  

**Key Observations:**  
- Attrition is highest among **low-salary employees (≈52%)**.  
- **Satisfaction Level** below 0.5 correlates strongly with attrition.  
- Employees with **no promotion in the last 5 years** show higher churn.  
- **Working hours:** Attrition peaks at both low (<150) and high (>280) monthly hours.  
- **Departments:** HR, Technical, and Support departments face the most attrition.  

**Visual Insights (Power BI Dashboard):**  
- **KPIs Displayed:** Total Employees, Attrition Rate, Avg Monthly Hours, Avg Satisfaction.  
- **Charts Include:**  
  - Attrition by Salary, Department, Projects, Promotions.  
  - Satisfaction trend by Evaluation Score.  
  - Attrition vs Average Monthly Hours.

## 🧪 Hypothesis Testing  

| Hypothesis | Test Used | p-value | Result | Interpretation |
|-------------|------------|----------|----------|----------------|
| Salary affects attrition | Chi-Square | < 0.05 | Reject H₀ | Salary has significant effect on attrition |
| Average monthly hours influence attrition | t-test | < 0.05 | Reject H₀ | Workload impacts employee retention |
| Promotion status affects attrition | Chi-Square | < 0.05 | Reject H₀ | Lack of promotion drives attrition |

📌 **Conclusion:** Salary, workload, and promotions significantly influence attrition.

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model  

### 🧱 Steps Performed  
1. Data Preprocessing – Encoding categorical features, scaling numerical ones.  
2. Train-Test Split – 80:20 ratio.  
3. Model Training – Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.  
4. Evaluation Metrics – Accuracy, Precision, Recall, Confusion Matrix.  
5. Hyperparameter Tuning – Used RandomizedSearchCV for optimization.  

### 🧮 Model Comparison  

| Model | Accuracy | Comments |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Logistic Regression | 85% | Interpretable baseline model |
| Random Forest | **88%** | Best accuracy, stable results |
| XGBoost (Tuned) | 88% | Similar accuracy; no major gain post tuning |

✅ **Final Choice:** **Random Forest Classifier** (high accuracy + interpretability)  

### 📊 Feature Importance  
1. Satisfaction Level  
2. Average Monthly Hours  
3. Salary  
4. Number of Projects  
5. Promotion in Last 5 Years
